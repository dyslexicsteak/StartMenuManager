SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Overview of the StartMenuManager PowerShell module, its cmdlets, licensing,
    and how to obtain its source code.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    StartMenuManager is a PowerShell module designed to help users manage the
    Windows Start Menu through a set of dedicated cmdlets. The module provides
    a streamlined way to enable, disable, toggle, and check the state of the
    Start Menu without manual intervention.

    StartMenuManager ships with four cmdlets:
      - Enable-StartMenu: Enables the Windows Start Menu if it has been disabled.
      - Disable-StartMenu: Disables the Windows Start Menu.
      - Invoke-ToggleStartMenu: Toggles the Start Menu between enabled and
        disabled states.
      - Get-StartMenuEnabled: Reports whether the Start Menu is currently
        enabled.

    These cmdlets are designed to be scriptable, idempotent, and reversible.

    StartMenuManager is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0),
    which allows you to use, modify, and distribute the software under its terms.

    The full source code for StartMenuManager is available on GitHub.

EXAMPLES
    To disable the Start Menu:
        Disable-StartMenu

    To enable the Start Menu:
        Enable-StartMenu

    To toggle the Start Menu:
        Invoke-ToggleStartMenu

    To check if the Start Menu is enabled:
        Get-StartMenuEnabled

NOTE
    Administrative privileges are required to enable, disable, or toggle the
    start menu. Always review the documentation for each cmdlet before use.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If a cmdlet fails, ensure the module is loaded and that you are running a
    compatible version of PowerShell with the necessary permissions. Create an
    issue on GitHub if you require further assistance.
