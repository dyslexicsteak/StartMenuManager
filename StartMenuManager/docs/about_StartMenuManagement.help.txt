SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Techniques and concepts for managing the Windows Start Menu.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Start Menu lives in the
    `Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy` app directory
    located in `Windows\SystemApps`. Disabling the Start Menu can be achieved by
    terminating the `StartMenuExperienceHost` process, which is an instance of
    the program `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe` responsible for the Start Menu.
    The `explorer.exe` shell continuously attempts to restart this process by a
    hard-coded path to it in the app directory; by renaming or deleting the
    directory, the shell is unable to recognize the directory and consequently
    locate and restart the process. Enabling the Start Menu after making
    `explorer.exe` unable to locate the program simply involves restoring the
    original directory name, as `explorer.exe` will automatically restart the
    process once the directory is valid again.

    This method involves dealing with a race condition between terminating the
    `StartMenuExperienceHost` process and renaming the directory. The
    `explorer.exe` shell is designed to monitor and restart certain processes
    like `StartMenuExperienceHost` almost immediately after they are terminated.
    This means that even after successfully terminating the process,
    `explorer.exe` may restart it before we are able to rename the directory;
    this requires repeated termination of `StartMenuExperienceHost` followed by
    an attempt to rename before the process is restarted by `explorer.exe` and
    re-establishes a lock on the directory.

    In some cases, `explorer.exe` itself retains a lock on the
    `Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy` directory, even
    after the `StartMenuExperienceHost` process has been terminated. When this
    occurs, attempts to rename or delete the directory will fail due to the
    active lock held by `explorer.exe`. Resolving this issue by terminating
    `explorer.exe` is a potential solution, though it temporarily disrupts the
    desktop environment.

    An alternative approach to disabling the Start Menu involves modifying the
    security permissions of the `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe` executable itself.
    By removing all permissions from the executable, the system is effectively
    prevented from executing the program, which disables the Start Menu. This
    method bypasses the race condition associated with renaming the directory,
    as the executable remains in place but cannot be launched. To re-enable the
    Start Menu after this, permissions can be restored to allow execution of
    `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`.

EXAMPLES
    Disabling the Start Menu can be achieved by either renaming the
    `Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy` directory or
    modifying the permissions of the `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe` executable to
    remove execution rights. Enabling the Start Menu reverses these steps by
    restoring the original directory name or permissions.

NOTE
    Administrative privileges are required for these operations. These
    techniques rely on the internal structure of the `SystemApps` folder. The
    `explorer.exe` shell is responsible for managing the Start Menu and related
    desktop components. Be aware of the race condition and potential locks held
    by `explorer.exe` when performing these operations. When modifying
    permissions, ensure you have a way to restore them if needed.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If renaming the directory fails, ensure no processes are actively using it.
    Verify that the user has administrative privileges.
